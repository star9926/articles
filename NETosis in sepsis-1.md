>- Neutrophil depletion: To evaluate the overall contribution of neutrophils to NETs, we injected (i.p.) the Ly6G-specific monoclonal antibody 1A8 (Bio X Cell, Lebanon, NH, USA; 1.0 mg per mouse) to selectively deplete neutrophils19 24 h before sepsis induction. Antibody efficacy for neutrophil depletion was 90% evaluated using a routine automated haematology analyser. When mouse IgG was used as control for neutrophil depletion, no significant changes in circulating neutrophils was detected.
>- Digestion of NETs: Briefly, 50 mg kg−1 DNase I (Merck, Hertfordshire, UK) was injected (i.p.) at 1 and 5 h after CLP induction, and the mice were euthanised by cervical dislocation at 10 h.

>- The raw data presented in the study are deposited in the NCBI repository, accession number PRJNA884333. Scripts used for processing and analyses have been deposited along with processed QIIME2 artifact files at: https://github.com/wzacs1/Araujo_nNIF.
>- Live cell imaging of NETs: We evaluated mouse NET formation via live cell imaging with confocal microscopy as previously described (12). Sham mice and CLP animals from all experimental groups were euthanized by CO2 inhalation and the peritoneal fluid was collected. An aliquot of 100 μL of the peritoneal fluid was placed on glass coverslips coated with poly-L-lysine for 1 hour at 37°C in 5% CO2/95% air. NET formation was assessed using cell-permeable (SYTO Green, Molecular Probes) and cell-impermeable (SYTOX Orange, Molecular Probes) DNA fluorescent stains. Using a FV3000 1X81 confocal microscope and FluoView software (Olympus) with 20X and 60X objectives, we obtained z-series images over a range of 20 μm with a 1 μm step size for each field. We processed these images using FluoView (Olympus), Photoshop (Adobe), and ImageJ (NIH) software.
>- MPO-DNA complex ELISA: An in-house ELISA was used to quantify MPO-DNA complexes in plasma and peritoneal fluid from sham and CLP mice 24 hours after the surgical procedure (24, 27). Briefly, after overnight coating with anti-MPO capture antibody in calcium carbonate coating buffer (2 µg/ml; 0400-0002, Bio-Rad) at 4°C, a 96-well plate was blocked with 2.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 2 hours at room temperature. The plate was subsequently washed, before incubating for 90 minutes at room temperature with 10% peritoneal fluid in blocking buffer. The plate was washed five times, and then incubated for 90 minutes at room temperature with anti-DNA detection antibody (1:20; Cell Death detection ELISA, 11544675001, Sigma). After five washes, the plate was developed with TMB substrate solution (Sigma).
>- Cytokine measurement and number of colony-forming units: Peritoneal fluid cytokines were analyzed using a mouse Cytokine/Chemokine Panel I Multiplex Array (Millipore Sigma catalog# HCYTMAG60-PMX41) according to manufacturer’s instructions on a Luminex 200 instrument. Bacterial counts in whole blood and peritoneal lavage were determined 24 hours after CLP. Briefly, peritoneal fluid and blood samples were collected, serially diluted, plated on LB-agar dishes, and incubated at 37°C for 24 hours. The number of bacterial colonies was counted and expressed as CFU/mL.

>- NETs quantification: Plasma or homogenate from the lung was incubated overnight in a plate pre-coated with anti-MPO antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific; cat. PA5-16672) at 4 °C. The plate was washed with PBS-T (Phosphate-Buffered Saline with Tween 20). Next, samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Finally, the plate with samples was washed and over MPO-bound DNA was quantified using the Quant-iT PicoGreen kit (Invitrogen; cat. P11496).
>- Neutrophils isolation and NETs purification: Peripheral blood samples were collected from healthy controls by venipuncture and the neutrophil population was isolated by Percoll density gradient (GE Healthcare; cat. 17-5445-01). Isolated neutrophils (1.5 × 107 cells) were stimulated with 50 nM of PMA (Sigma-Aldrich; cat. P8139) for 4 h at 37 °C. The medium containing NETs was centrifuged at 450 g to remove cellular debris for 10 min, and NETs-containing supernatants were collected and centrifuged at 18,000 g for 20 min. Supernatants were removed, and DNA pellets were resuspended in PBS. NETs were then quantified with a **GeneQuant (Amersham Biosciences Corporation)**.

>- In a prospective controlled double-armed animal trial, polymicrobial sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). After CLP, mice were treated with rhDNase or phosphate buffered saline, respectively. Survival, colony forming unit (CFU) counts in the peritoneal cavity, lung, liver and blood were determined. PMN and platelet counts, IL-6 and circulating free (cf)-DNA/NETs levels were monitored. PMN infiltration, as well as organ damage, was analyzed histologically in the lungs and liver. Capability and capacity of PMN to form NETs were determined over time.

>- Reparixin (formerly known as repertaxin) was previously described as a non-competitive allosteric inhibitor of IL-8 receptors with a 400-fold higher efficacy in inhibiting CXCR1 activity than CXCR2 (Bertini et al., 2004). Reparixin efficiently inhibits the biological events triggered by IL-8 by binding to the transmembrane (TM) region of CXCR1 in an allosteric cavity within the helixes TM1, 2, 3, 6 and 7 (Bertini et al., 2004). The efficacy of reparixin in preventing PMN recruitment and associated tissue damage was shown in experimental models of I/R injury (Bertini et al., 2004; Souza et al., 2004; Garau et al., 2005) and organ transplantation (Cugini et al., 2005). The drug is currently under clinical development.
>- Molecular modelling studies: All calculations were performed using an IBM e Server 326 Cluster, under the Red Hat Enterprise WS3 operating system. The sequence alignment of CXCR2 and CXCR1 was performed by using the MUSCLE software (Edgar, 2004). The conformational analysis of the ligands was performed with the Systematic torsional sampling method implemented in Macromodel 8.6 software (Schrodinger, LLC, Portland, OR). Atomic charges and potentials were fixed using the standard OPLS2001 force field, and the energy level was fixed at 50 kJ·mol−1. The minimum-energy conformer of each ligand was manually docked in the putative binding cavity of CXCR1 and CXCR2 homology models. With the aim of relaxing non-bonding interactions in the system, the complexes were energy-refined using Steepest Descent and Conjugate Gradient algorithms as implemented in DISCOVER package (Accelrys Corporate, San Diego, CA), using the CVFF force field. All the molecular dynamics simulations were validated using CHARMm force field as implemented in Accelrys Discovery Studio 2.5.
>- Generation of L1.2 transfectants: Human chemokine receptors cDNA coding sequences were cloned in the pcDNA3.1 expression vector, sequence verified and used as templates to generate receptor mutants using the commercial Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Clontech, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France), following manufacturer's instructions. Mutants were fully sequenced to confirm the nucleotide substitution introduced.
>- G-protein activation assay: The IL-8/Eu-GTP binding assay was performed in a 96-well DELFIAR GTP binding kit; 5 µg of purified PMN plasma membranes for each sample in quadruplicates were treated for 10 min at 30°C with vehicle or DF 2156A (1 µM) and next incubated for 60 min at 30°C in 50 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 5 mM MgCl2, 3 µM GDP, 150 mM NaCl, 10 nM Eu-GTP, 100 nM IL-8. The plate was then washed three times on a vacuum manifold with 200 µL per well of washing buffer supplied by kit. The time-resolved fluorescence was then read using the Victor Plate Reader (Perkin Elmer, Fremont, NE).

>- The CXCR1/CXCR2 antagonism by non-competitive allosteric inhibitor ladarixin (Dompé Farmaceutici S.p.A., Milano, Italy) reduced MMP9 and leucocyte infiltration in a murine AAA model.4 
>- RT-qPCR showed that both 10 μM and 50 μM ladarixin downregulated CXCL1 gene (Figure 1D). Conversely, ladarixin unaffected the expression of CXCL8 and CXCR2 genes and did not upregulate RIPK3, excluding the activation of necroptotic pathway.

>- Blocking CXCR1/2 receptors increases survival in a murine model of alcoholic liver injury. CXCR1/2 pepducins revert steatosis and liver inflammation.
Alcohol-induced liver injury is neutrophil mediated.
>- ‘Pepducins’ are short peptides coupled to a lipid moiety that can be designed as agonists or antagonists with precise specificity in vitro and in vivo for a given GPCR.22–26 Pepducins integrate into the inner plasma membrane via a flip-flop mechanism and affect GPCR-dependent G-protein activation.27–29 We have reported pepducin ‘x1/2pal-i1’, specific for CXCR1 and CXCR2, which reverses established experimental systemic inflammatory response syndrome by inhibiting neutrophil activation.25 x1/2pal-i1 also abolishes tumour growth in a model of ovarian cancer30 and inhibits adenoma formation in Apcmin/+ mice.31

#################################################
harvest time should be based on the expression of cxc ligands and receptor, namely cxcr2,
so RNA-seq analysis from different timepoint should be included to get the pattern of expression.
Questions:
1. NETosis mainly located on lung, but liver, kidneys and heart? remain inconclusive.
2. NETosis is related to fibrin deposition.
3. the inhibition via CXCR2 antagonist have more prominent effect on lung, instead of liver.
