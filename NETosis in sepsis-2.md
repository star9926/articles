>- cfDNA/MPO (NET) quantification: The concentration of cf-DNA bound to MPO (cf-DNA/MPO), a constituent of NET, was also measured in the serum or plasma of septic mice.
This method allowed the identification of NETs in the circulation of the animals. Briefly, an antibody bound to the 96-well flat-bottom plate captured the enzyme MPO,
a constituent of NET, and the amount of DNA bound to the enzyme was quantified using the Quant-iT™ PicoGreen® kit (Invitrogen), as above.

>- Systemic leukocyte and platelet counts: Blood was collected from the tail vein and mixed with Turks solution (0.2 mg gentian violet in 1 ml glacial acetic acid, 6.25% vol/vol)
in a dilution of 1:20 for quantification of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) and monomorphonuclear leukocytes (MNL) or with Stromatol solution (Mascia Brunelli spa; Viale Monza,
Milan, Italy) in a dilution of 1:500 for identification of platelets in a Burker chamber.
