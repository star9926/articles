>- Neutrophil depletion: To evaluate the overall contribution of neutrophils to NETs, we injected (i.p.) the Ly6G-specific monoclonal antibody 1A8 (Bio X Cell, Lebanon, NH, USA; 1.0 mg per mouse) to selectively deplete neutrophils19 24 h before sepsis induction. Antibody efficacy for neutrophil depletion was 90% evaluated using a routine automated haematology analyser. When mouse IgG was used as control for neutrophil depletion, no significant changes in circulating neutrophils was detected.
>- Digestion of NETs: Briefly, 50 mg kg−1 DNase I (Merck, Hertfordshire, UK) was injected (i.p.) at 1 and 5 h after CLP induction, and the mice were euthanised by cervical dislocation at 10 h.

>- Live cell imaging of NETs: We evaluated mouse NET formation via live cell imaging with confocal microscopy as previously described (12). Sham mice and CLP animals from all experimental groups were euthanized by CO2 inhalation and the peritoneal fluid was collected. An aliquot of 100 μL of the peritoneal fluid was placed on glass coverslips coated with poly-L-lysine for 1 hour at 37°C in 5% CO2/95% air. NET formation was assessed using cell-permeable (SYTO Green, Molecular Probes) and cell-impermeable (SYTOX Orange, Molecular Probes) DNA fluorescent stains. Using a FV3000 1X81 confocal microscope and FluoView software (Olympus) with 20X and 60X objectives, we obtained z-series images over a range of 20 μm with a 1 μm step size for each field. We processed these images using FluoView (Olympus), Photoshop (Adobe), and ImageJ (NIH) software.
>- MPO-DNA complex ELISA: An in-house ELISA was used to quantify MPO-DNA complexes in plasma and peritoneal fluid from sham and CLP mice 24 hours after the surgical procedure (24, 27). Briefly, after overnight coating with anti-MPO capture antibody in calcium carbonate coating buffer (2 µg/ml; 0400-0002, Bio-Rad) at 4°C, a 96-well plate was blocked with 2.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 2 hours at room temperature. The plate was subsequently washed, before incubating for 90 minutes at room temperature with 10% peritoneal fluid in blocking buffer. The plate was washed five times, and then incubated for 90 minutes at room temperature with anti-DNA detection antibody (1:20; Cell Death detection ELISA, 11544675001, Sigma). After five washes, the plate was developed with TMB substrate solution (Sigma).
>- Cytokine measurement and number of colony-forming units: Peritoneal fluid cytokines were analyzed using a mouse Cytokine/Chemokine Panel I Multiplex Array (Millipore Sigma catalog# HCYTMAG60-PMX41) according to manufacturer’s instructions on a Luminex 200 instrument. Bacterial counts in whole blood and peritoneal lavage were determined 24 hours after CLP. Briefly, peritoneal fluid and blood samples were collected, serially diluted, plated on LB-agar dishes, and incubated at 37°C for 24 hours. The number of bacterial colonies was counted and expressed as CFU/mL.

>- NETs quantification: Plasma or homogenate from the lung was incubated overnight in a plate pre-coated with anti-MPO antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific; cat. PA5-16672) at 4 °C. The plate was washed with PBS-T (Phosphate-Buffered Saline with Tween 20). Next, samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Finally, the plate with samples was washed and over MPO-bound DNA was quantified using the Quant-iT PicoGreen kit (Invitrogen; cat. P11496).
>- Neutrophils isolation and NETs purification: Peripheral blood samples were collected from healthy controls by venipuncture and the neutrophil population was isolated by Percoll density gradient (GE Healthcare; cat. 17-5445-01). Isolated neutrophils (1.5 × 107 cells) were stimulated with 50 nM of PMA (Sigma-Aldrich; cat. P8139) for 4 h at 37 °C. The medium containing NETs was centrifuged at 450 g to remove cellular debris for 10 min, and NETs-containing supernatants were collected and centrifuged at 18,000 g for 20 min. Supernatants were removed, and DNA pellets were resuspended in PBS. NETs were then quantified with a **GeneQuant (Amersham Biosciences Corporation)**.

>- In a prospective controlled double-armed animal trial, polymicrobial sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). After CLP, mice were treated with rhDNase or phosphate buffered saline, respectively. Survival, colony forming unit (CFU) counts in the peritoneal cavity, lung, liver and blood were determined. PMN and platelet counts, IL-6 and circulating free (cf)-DNA/NETs levels were monitored. PMN infiltration, as well as organ damage, was analyzed histologically in the lungs and liver. Capability and capacity of PMN to form NETs were determined over time.

The Impact of Cytokines on Neutrophils' Phagocytosis and NET Formation during Sepsis-A Review

#################################################
harvest time should be based on the expression of cxc ligands and receptor, namely cxcr2,
so RNA-seq analysis from different timepoint should be included to get the pattern of expression.
Questions:
1. NETosis mainly located on lung, but liver, kidneys and heart? remain inconclusive.
2. NETosis is related to fibrin deposition.
3. the inhibition via CXCR2 antagonist have more prominent effect on lung, instead of liver.
