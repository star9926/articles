The Impact of Cytokines on Neutrophils' Phagocytosis and NET Formation during Sepsis-A Review

#################################################
harvest time should be based on the expression of cxc ligands and receptor, namely cxcr2,
so RNA-seq analysis from different timepoint should be included to get the pattern of expression.
Questions:
1. NETosis mainly located on lung, but liver, kidneys and heart? remain inconclusive.
2. NETosis is related to fibrin deposition.
3. the inhibition via CXCR2 antagonist have more prominent effect on lung, instead of liver.

reproduce the research:
previous results:
1. NET formation in vivo positively correlates with the ex vivo NET assay;
2. NET formation is associated with fibrin deposition and lung injury in murine sepsis;
3. Elevated levels of CXCR1/2 ligands in both patients with sepsis and mouse sepsis models 
are associated with ex vivo NET formation;
4. Blocking CXCR1/2 signalling using reparixin Reparixin;
5. Blocking CXCR1/2 signalling reduces fibrin deposition and organ injury and improves survival in sepsis mice;

new results:
1. 24 hours after PCI, harvest liver and blood for immune cell isolation;
2. metabolics changes;
3. fibrin deposition, and organ injury and mortality.
