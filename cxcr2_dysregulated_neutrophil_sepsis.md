Distinguishing Sepsis From Infection by Neutrophil Dysfunction: A Promising Role of CXCR2 Surface Level
#####
use flow cytometry to distinguish dysregulated neutrophils from peripheral blood, 
Healthy neutrophils have a negligible level of CD64 and CCR2 surface receptors (13, 14) 
while having abundant CXCR2 surface receptors (15). Compared to normal neutrophils, 
previous studies have proposed the following neutrophil dysfunctions as sepsis-related: 
increased phagocytic activity through upregulation of CD64 receptors 
and transmigration abnormalities due to upregulation of CCR2 receptors or internalization of CXCR2 receptors (3â€“5).

also for NETosis and apoptosis! 

resutls: only CXCR2 surface level is associated with sepsis.
comparison of neutrophil functions between septic shock and infected patients;
association between neutrophil functions and clinical outcomes.
