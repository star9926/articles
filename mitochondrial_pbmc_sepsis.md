alternation of mitochondrial function regulated immune response of immune cells!!!
#######################################
results:
1. correlation of PBMC mitochondrial respiration and citrate synthase activity with percentage of immune celltypes;
2. correlation of PBMC mitochondrial respiration and citrate synthase activity with percentage of CD4+ and CD8 tcells;
3. composition of immune cell subtypes in control and sepsis patients;
4. Predicted PBMC mitochondrial respiration and citrate synthase activity
