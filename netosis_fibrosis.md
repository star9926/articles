>- Peripheral blood from Pad4−/− [4] or WT mice underwent red blood cell sedimentation with Hetastarch (6% hydroxyethyl starch, HES) in 0.9% NaCl solution
(Hospira, Inc., Lake Forest, IL) at 1:4 v/v dilution at 37°C and then was resuspended in RPMI1640. The flow-based assay described herein is performed entirely in suspension. 
>-  invitro stimulations and then fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, blocked for 30 min with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma) in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS, Life Technologies) at 37°C and,
without a permeabilization step, incubated sequentially with the primary anti-histone H3 antibody (citrulline 2,8,17, ab5103; Abcam, Cambridge, MA) at 1:300 dilution, Alexa Fluor700-conjugated
secondary antibody (A-21038, Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) at 1:300 dilution and FITC-conjugated anti-myeloperoxidase antibody (mouse: ab90812, 1:50 dilution; human: ab11729, 1:10 dilution, Abcam).
>- . Each incubation was followed by a wash with 2% BSA in DPBS and centrifugation at 16,400 rpm at 4°C for 20 minutes. Samples were then resuspended in 2% BSA in DPBS containing Hoechst 33342, trihydrochloride trihydrate, (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) at 1:5000 dilution and analyzed by flow-cytometry according to the gating strategy detailed in Figure S1. There is no selection on the FSC/SSC properties, as those are very heterogenous for NETs in suspension. A minimum of 10,000 cells per condition were analyzed in duplicates.
